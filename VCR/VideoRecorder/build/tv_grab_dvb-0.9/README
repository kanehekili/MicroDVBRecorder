08/05/2004 - Ver 0.5 Released

  First fairly usable release, with correct time information!
  I've only had UK testers report back so far with this release
  Thanks to Steve Davies and Mark Kendall for their helpful suggestions
  and testing with the London 8 day EPG broadcast test.

  If you are getting any Unknown ID:?? in your output, let me know
  if you know what this should be. In the UK we seem to be getting
  a lot of 'f0' which I can't find out what they are meant to be.
  Eastenders seems to be categorised with it, but so does a range
  of murder mystery things.  Update:  It appears to be Drama
  Let me know anything else please.

REQUIREMENTS
------------

* DVB Card Working in linux already, and tuned to a multiplex.

USAGE
-----

It reads a channels.conf file tzap format in the current directory to decode th
e channel names (at the moment)
May not always need this.

Tested with:
        UK Freeview Now/Next
        UK London 8 Day EPG test
        Germany/Berlin DVB-T Now/Next
        Sweden DVB-S
        Let Me Know!

Tune into a multiplex with whatever you like, dvbtune, mplayer, mythtv and run:

tv_grab_dvb [-t timeout] > whatson.xml

HINTS
-----

Mythtv:

tv_grab_dvb|mythfilldatabase --no-delete --file 1 0 -

Works well for me to stop it messing about all the channels.
