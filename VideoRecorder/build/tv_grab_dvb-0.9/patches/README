A couple of subtitle info patches for UK descriptions.

I'm a little reluctant to add these at the moment, as I can't test them
(No TV Antenna in new flat yet) and they need a little work so they don't 
affect people outside the UK. I might do a hybrid patch of both. Cheers to 
Jon Dye <jon_pecorous_co_uk> and John Pullan <jmp_tarantella_com> for 
supplying them.
